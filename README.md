---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.10.4 or higher
- Dart SDK
- Firebase account with a configured project
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)
- Python (for web scraper - if running backend)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swipy_app.git
   cd swipy_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password)
   - Enable **Cloud Firestore**
   - Download `google-services.json` (Android) and place it in `android/app/`
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place it in `ios/Runner/`
   - Run Firebase CLI to generate configuration:
     ```bash
     flutterfire configure
     ```

4. **Firestore Database Structure**
   
   Create the following collections in Firestore:
   
   **Collection: `news_segments`**
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Article Title",
     "summary": "Brief summary of the article",
     "source": "News Source Name",
     "articleUrl": "https://example.com/article",
     "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
   }
   ```
   
   **Collection: `users/{userId}/saved`** (auto-created)
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Saved Article Title",
     "summary": "Article summary",
     "source": "Source",
     "articleUrl": "https://example.com/article",
     "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
     "savedAt": "Timestamp"
   }
   ```

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### 🐍 Running the News Scraper (Python)

The backend script (`main.py`) fetches the latest tech news, summarizes it using AI, and uploads it to Firestore.

1.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Setup Credentials**
    - Place your Firebase Admin SDK key as `service-account.json` in the root directory.
    - **Configuration**: Open `main.py` and update the following keys:
      ```python
      NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY"
      OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
      ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > **Security Alert**: The `main.py` file contains sensitive API keys. **DO NOT commit this file to public repositories** if you have added real keys. It is recommended to use environment variables (e.g., `python-dotenv`) for production.

3.  **Run the Script**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will:
    - Fetch top tech headlines from NewsAPI
    - Skip articles without images
    - Check if the article already exists in Firestore (deduplication)
    - Summarize the content using OpenAI
    - Save the processed news card to Firestore

## 📱 App Structure

```
lib/
├── main.dart           # App entry point, main swipe screen, news cards

#### 2. **News Card** (`NewsCard`)
- Displays article image, title, summary, and source
- Smart bookmark button with duplicate prevention
- Share functionality
- Real-time bookmark status sync with Firestore

#### 3. **Login Page** (`LoginPage`)
- Email/password authentication
- Toggle between login and signup modes
- Firebase Auth integration

#### 4. **Saved Page** (`SavedPage`)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: `#E94057` (Vibrant coral-red)
- **Background**: White
- **Text**: Black with gradient overlays on cards

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Poppins (via Google Fonts)
- Clean, modern, and highly readable

### UX Principles
1. **Gesture-First**: Primary interactions through intuitive swipes
2. **Minimal Friction**: No unnecessary taps or navigation
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for all actions
4. **Speed**: Cached images and optimized loading

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Security Rules

**Firestore Rules** (`firestore.rules`):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // News segments - read-only for authenticated users
    match /news_segments/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only admins via backend
    }
    
    // User saved articles - private per user
    match /users/{userId}/saved/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

**Authentication Rules**:
- Email/Password authentication enabled
- Users can only access their own saved articles

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase not initializing**
   - Ensure `google-services.json` is in `android/app/`
   - Run `flutterfire configure` to regenerate config
   - Check Firebase project settings

2. **Cards not loading**
   - Verify Firestore has `news_segments` collection with data
   - Check Firestore security rules allow read access
   - Ensure user is authenticated

3. **Images not displaying**
   - Verify `imageUrl` fields contain valid URLs
   - Check internet connection
   - Clear app cache

4. **Bookmark not saving**
   - Check Firestore security rules for `users/{userId}/saved`
   - Verify user is authenticated
   - Check console for errors
